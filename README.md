# AirQualityControlSystem
Atmega328p Based all info is in readme.md
I am interested in this project as air quality is become such an important thing now days during the pandemic. As Covid is airborne it is good to know whats in the air around us. The main purpose is to determine air quality and temperature in surrounding area. The similar projects online donâ€™t have it all combined [temperature, pressure, air dust, gas].
